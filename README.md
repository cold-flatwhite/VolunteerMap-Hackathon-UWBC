# VolunteerMap-Hackathon-UWBC
Welcome to HackathonMap: UWBC Edition! This project is part of our participation in the Hackathon competition. Our goal is to create a user-friendly web application that allows UWBC (United Way of Big City) volunteers to easily select and mark locations on a map for efficient logistics planning and coordination.
